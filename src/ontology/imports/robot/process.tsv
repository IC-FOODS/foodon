FOODON:00002814	ikajime	food treatment process				Ikejime is a method of slaughtering fish to maintain the quality of its meat. The technique originated in Japan, but is now in widespread use. It involves the insertion of a spike quickly and directly into the hindbrain, usually located slightly behind and above the eye, thereby causing immediate brain death.	When spiked correctly, the fish fins flare and the fish relaxes, immediately ceasing all motion. Destroying the brain and the spinal cord of the fish will prevent reflex action from happening; such muscle movements would otherwise consume adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the muscle, and as a result produce lactic acid and ammonia, making the fish sour, soggy and less tasteful. Furthermore, the blood contained in the fish flesh retracts to the gut cavity, which produces a better coloured and flavoured fillet, and prolongs shelf life.

Specific rules are given in the scope note for the individual ingredient added; these rules specify more exhaustive indexing. For example, *MUSHROOM ADDED* is indexed regardless of ingredient position. another specific rule is given in the scope note for *SALTED*:  Use if the level of salt is more than 4%.
